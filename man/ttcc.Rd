\usage{
ttcc(time, ttp, threshold, interval, compare = "gt")
}
\arguments{
\item{time}{a vector of numeric data representing the time of each observation}

\item{ttp}{a vector of numeric data representing Time to Positivity (TTP)}

\item{threshold}{a numeric bound for the value of `ttp``}

\item{interval}{a numeric upper bound for the length between two observations}

\item{compare}{a string to specify whether threshold is a lower (default) or
upper bound. "gt" (greater than) is the default, and makes \verb{threshold`` a lower bound. "lt" (less than) makes }threshold`` an upper bound.}
}
\value{
a vector of 0s and 1s with the same length as \code{time}
}
\description{
Find consecutive negatives past some threshold occurring within an interval.

ttcc will assume that data is grouped by individual, so as to not compare
timestamps from two different patients. ttcc returns a vector which
has value 1 at index i if \verb{ttp\[i\]} at \verb{time\[i\]} is both greater than or equal
to (default), or less than or equal to \verb{threshold``, and is the ith consecutive such observation spaced at least }interval`` apart.

       ttp = DVTTP,
       TTCC = ttcc(TIME, DVTTP, threshold = 30, interval = 25)
   )
